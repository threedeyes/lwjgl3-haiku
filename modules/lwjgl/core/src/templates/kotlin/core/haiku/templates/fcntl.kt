            as a negative value. Most commonly, the calling process specifies itself as the owner (that is, {@code arg} is specified as {@code getpid(2)}).

            As well as setting the file descriptor owner, one must also enable generation of signals on the file descriptor. This is done by using the
            {@code fcntl()} #F_SETFL command to set the #O_ASYNC file status flag on the file descriptor. Subsequently, a {@code SIGIO} signal is sent whenever
            input or output becomes possible on the file descriptor. The {@code fcntl()} #F_SETSIG command can be used to obtain delivery of a signal other
            than {@code SIGIO}.

            Sending a signal to the owner process (group) specified by {@code F_SETOWN} is subject to the same permissions checks as are described for
            {@code kill(2)}, where the sending process is the one that employs {@code F_SETOWN} (but see BUGS below). If this permission check fails, then the
            signal is silently discarded. Note: The {@code F_SETOWN} operation records the caller's credentials at the time of the {@code fcntl()} call, and it
            is these saved credentials that are used for the permission checks.

            If the file descriptor {@code fd} refers to a socket, {@code F_SETOWN} also selects the recipient of {@code SIGURG} signals that are delivered when
            out-of-band data arrives on that socket. ({@code SIGURG} is sent in any situation where {@code select(2)} would report the socket as having an
            "exceptional condition".)

            The following was true in 2.6.x kernels up to and including kernel 2.6.11:

            If a nonzero value is given to #F_SETSIG in a multithreaded process running with a threading library that supports thread groups (e.g., NPTL), then
            a positive value given to {@code F_SETOWN} has a different meaning: instead of being a process ID identifying a whole process, it is a thread ID
            identifying a specific thread within a process. Consequently, it may be necessary to pass {@code F_SETOWN} the result of {@code gettid(2)} instead
            of {@code getpid(2)} to get sensible results when {@code F_SETSIG} is used. (In current Linux threading implementations, a main thread's thread ID
            is the same as its process ID. This means that a single-threaded program can equally use {@code gettid(2)} or {@code getpid(2)} in this scenario.)
            Note, however, that the statements in this paragraph do not apply to the {@code SIGURG} signal generated for out-of-band data on a socket: this
            signal is always sent to either a process or a process group, depending on the value given to {@code F_SETOWN}.

            The above behavior was accidentally dropped in Linux 2.6.12, and won't be restored. From Linux 2.6.32 onward, use #F_SETOWN_EX to target
            {@code SIGIO} and {@code SIGURG} signals at a particular thread.

            By using {@code F_SETSIG} with a nonzero value, and setting {@code SA_SIGINFO} for the signal handler (see {@code sigaction(2)}), extra information
            about I/O events is passed to the handler in a {@code siginfo_t} structure. If the {@code si_code} field indicates the source is {@code SI_SIGIO},
            the {@code si_fd} field gives the file descriptor associated with the event. Otherwise, there is no indication which file descriptors are pending,

            file descriptors are available for I/O.

            Note that the file descriptor provided in {@code si_fd} is the one that was specified during the {@code F_SETSIG} operation. This can lead to an

            (In order to obtain these definitions, the {@code _GNU_SOURCE} feature test macro must be defined before including any header files.)

            Directory notifications are normally "one-shot", and the application must reregister to receive further notifications. Alternatively, if
            #DN_MULTISHOT is included in {@code arg}, then notification will remain in effect until explicitly removed.

            A series of {@code F_NOTIFY} requests is cumulative, with the events in {@code arg} being added to the set already monitored. To disable
            notification of all events, make an {@code F_NOTIFY} call specifying {@code arg} as 0.

            Notification occurs via delivery of a signal. The default signal is {@code SIGIO}, but this can be changed using the #F_SETSIG command to
            {@code fcntl()}. (Note that {@code SIGIO} is one of the nonqueuing standard signals; switching to the use of a real-time signal means that multiple
            notifications can be queued to the process.) In the latter case, the signal handler receives a {@code siginfo_t} structure as its second argument
            (if the handler was established using {@code SA_SIGINFO}) and the {@code si_fd} field of this structure contains the file descriptor which
            generated the notification (useful when establishing notification on multiple directories).

            Especially when using {@code DN_MULTISHOT}, a real time signal should be used for notification, so that multiple notifications can be queued.

            NOTE: New applications should use the {@code inotify} interface (available since kernel 2.6.13), which provides a much superior interface for
            obtaining notifications of filesystem events. See {@code inotify(7)}.
